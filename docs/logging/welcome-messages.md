All these messages will be sent to the channel saved with `!set welcome`. **Use a command without any text to remove the message.** Supports the following variables:

`{mention}` - Pings the user

`{user}` - The name of the user

`{server}` - The name of the server

`{user(id)}` - The ID of the user

`{user(proper)}` - The name including the last four digits \(Carl\#0001\).

`{server(members)}` - The number of members on the server \(after the event has happened\). Use `{ord:{server(members)}}` to turn 8102 into 8,102nd etc.

Also supports `{random: lists, separated by commas}` and `{math: 1 + 1} math blocks` not sure when you'd ever want a math block but random lists are pretty useful.
